## Structure Matters: Brain Graph Augmentation via Learnable Edge Masking for Data-efficient Psychiatric Diagnosis

We propose SAM-BG, a framework designed for low-supervision settings that uses structure-aware augmentation via edge masking to learn robust, biologically meaningful brain graph representations from large-scale, unlabeled fMRI data.
